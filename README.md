## Hepatitis B virus: novel therapies and induction of hepatocellular carcinoma

Nowadays the virus of hepatitis B is one of the most insidious viruses that affect chronically nearly 350 Million people worldwide, but only 8% know about their condition. It is estimated that 15-40 % of the infected patients could develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or liver failure, between 0,5-1,2 million die each year due to the complications. 

Since governments started the immunization of newborn with the HBV vaccine program, the incidence of new infections had plummeted. The remaining population who had already been infected remain in a chronic state, most of them without knowing their conditions, it is an important issue because there are treatments when the virus starts to replicate and nutritional strategies that could render the patients in an inactive state for a longer period of time, those approaches could potentially reduce the incidence of the complications such as HCC and subsequent high rate of mortality. 

This project is summarizing information on the recent bibliography in research of new approaches on the therapy and treatment of hepatitis B currently on research.
